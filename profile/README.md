Supporters of Gege Circle and this project are called **"Getuanzi"** (‚ÄãÊààÂõ¢Â≠ê).

The term "Getuanzi" originated from a giant panda named "Tuanzi" (Âõ¢Â≠ê) born in 2015, it also refers to a Japanese dumpling - Dango (Âõ£Â≠ê), both symbolizing reunion, unity, friendship, and collective aspirations. We officially adopted "Getuanzi" as the fanbase name in early 2021.

Since Wang Ge's previous videos did not provide detailed information about this project and contained ambiguous descriptions, we have created this repository to formally introduce **Gege Circle** in written form.

Gege Circle established on July 14, 2018, has always adhered to principles of inclusivity, openness, harmony, and kindness. We are fully aware of our responsibilities and mission, consistently respecting social ethics, strictly complying with laws and regulations, and actively contributing to maintaining social stability and public interests.

Therefore, **we prohibit any individuals or organizations from posting inappropriate remarks under the name of "Gege Circle"** on online websites or in real life. **We also firmly oppose excessive promotion of Gege Circle**, including but not limited to **mentioning Gege Circle or its members in danmu, comment, or any other form within videos unrelated to the project**.

While we understand that mentions of Gege Circle in unrelated videos might stem from unintentional enthusiasm, **such behavior causes trouble** for creators and viewers of those unrelated videos. Additionally, Gege Circle itself has faced significant backlash due to these incidents.

As members of Gege Circle, we **kindly ask for your cooperation**:

If you encounter danmu and comments mentioning Gege Circle in unrelated videos, please **report** them to have such danmu and comments removed.

**"Unrelated to Gege Circle" refers to content neither produced by Gege Circle/our project members nor directly mentioning Gege Circle**. When seeing people mentioning Gege Circle in unrelated videos, let's all report them - **don't argue, just report**.

Don't respond to those randomly spamming Gege Circle either. If one spam comment gets flooded with 99 "stop spamming" replies, it creates another problematic scenario. So just silently click report! Quietly, quietly click report! **No engagement, no disputes**!

If anyone says "why can't I spam Gege Circle", send them this repository saying "**this is why Gege Circle prohibits spamming**". If they want to argue, tell them to come debate with us!

If random Gege Circle spamming persists, **we'll keep emphasizing this**. We'll emphasize it endlessly. please work with **us to eliminate this spamming phenomenon** - we beg you all, sincerely, PLEASE!

So...

At the end of this repository, let's whisper an open secret we all know~

In truth, Gege Circle has always regarded you all as dear friends or closest siblings, sharing every fleeting moment together~

To us, each of you is a unique, vibrant individual, carrying rich life stories and emotional tides - laughter, sorrow, anger, frustration. These raw, tender feelings transform you from mere digital presences into treasured companions. It is this shared resonance and understanding that binds us, walking forward hand in hand.

Similarly, we yearn to become that friend in your hearts - the one you can confide in at any time, sharing both joys and sorrows. Whether bursting with happiness or weighed down by tears, remember: **Gege Circle and we are always here**. We may not reply instantly, but our care and presence remain constant - **we are here, always**~

These words might feel more fitting for a special occasion, but since they surge from our hearts now, we couldn't wait to tell you. After all, sincerity warms the soul, no matter when it's spoken.

Finally, let's make an eternal promise! To be forever friends‚Äîhowever long "forever" stretches - we vow to stand by you, offering support and companionship whenever needed.  

**This gratitude shall forever dwell in our hearts!** üíñ
